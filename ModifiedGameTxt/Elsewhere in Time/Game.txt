@NEWXFORM

@title=New Order: Transform
The new Engineers unit type can use the

change the terrain type in a square.
Engineers also work twice as quickly as
Settlers in all ordinary tasks (roadbuilding,
irrigation, etc).

@NEWFORTRESS
@width=320

double the defense of units defending within,
and prevent more than one unit at a time from
being lost in combat.

@NEWAIRLIFT
@width=320
@title=New Orders: Airlift and Airbase
Our ground units may now use the Airlift ("l")

Airports.  Our Settlers/Engineers may use the
Airbase ("e") order to build airbases in non-city
squares.

@NEWRAILROAD
@width=320
@title=New Order: Railroad

production by 50%%. Units moving along railroads
expend no movement points to do so.

@NEWFARMLAND
@width=320
@title=New Order: Farmland
Our Settlers/Engineers may now use the Farmland ("i")

production by 50%%, but only for cities containing
the Supermarket improvement.

@NEWPARADROP
