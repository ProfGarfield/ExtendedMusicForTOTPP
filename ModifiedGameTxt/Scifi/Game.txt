@NEWXFORM
@width=320
@title=New Order: Transform
Now that you have the requisite technology,
Environeers can use the new Transform ("o")
order to drastically change the terrain type
in a square. These units also work twice as
quickly as their predecessors in all ordinary
tasks (road building, cultivation, etc).

@NEWFORTRESS
@width=320
@title=New Order: Force Field
Colonists, Environeers, Nidus, and the Melior
can now use the Force Field ("f") order to build
permanent force fields.  These fortifications
double the defense of units defending within,
and prevent more than one unit at a time from
being lost in combat.

@NEWAIRLIFT
@width=320
@title=New Orders: Instaport and Service Pad
We can now give our ground units the Instaport ("l")
order to move them between any of our cities on the
same map with Instaporters. Also, the Service Pad ("e")
order causes a Colonist, Environeer, Nidus, or Melior
to build an air unit Service Pad in a non-city square.

@NEWRAILROAD
@width=320
@title=New Order: Slideways
Colonists, Environeers, Nidus, and the Melior can
now be ordered to build Slideways ("r") in squares
that already contain roads. Frictionless slideways
increase the square's materiel production by 50%%.
Units moving along slideways expend no movement
points to do so.

@NEWFARMLAND
@width=320
@title=New Order: Tohubohu
You are now able to build Harvesters in your cities.
After you have discovered Prionic Stabilizers, your
Colonists, Environeer, Nidus, and Melior units will
be able to obey the Tohubohu ("i") order and use their
bioengineering skills to initiate the tohubohu reaction
in squares which are already cultivated. Tohubohu
increases a square's food production by 50%%, but only
for cities containing a Harvester. Thus, you might want
to prepare for this by building Harvesters ahead of time.

@NEWPARADROP
